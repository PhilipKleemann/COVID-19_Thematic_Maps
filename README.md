## COVID-19 Thematic Maps of the United States

# Project Description
This project displays two thematic maps in which both maps are based off of COVID-19 data. The goal was to create a clean and simple map design that could easily demonstrate patterns to viewers.

## Maps
- Map 1 is a chloropleth map of 2018 COVID-19 Rates per one-thousand people in each county.

- Map 2 is a proportional symbols map of COVID-19 cases in 2020 using circles of varying sizes to demonstrate larger and smaller populations with COVID-19.
